# qubolite

A light-weight toolbox for working with QUBO instances in NumPy.

## Installation

Ensure you have the Python development package installed for your Python version, e.g., for Python 3.11 running on Ubuntu,
```
apt install python3.11-dev
```

Then simply install `qubolite` itself from the PyPI repository through 
```
pip install qubolite
```

This package was created using Python 3.10, but runs with Python >= 3.8.

## Optional Dependencies

If you're planning to use the roof dual function as lower bound you will need to install optional
dependencies. The igraph based roof dual lower bound function can be used by calling 
`qubolite.bounds.lb_roof_dual()`. It requires that the [igraph](https://igraph.org/) library is 
installed. This can be done with `pip install igraph` or by installing qubolite with 
`pip install qubolite[roof_dual]`.

Using the function `qubolite.ordering_distance()` requires the Kendall-Ï„ measure from the
[scipy](https://scipy.org/) library which can be installed by `pip install scipy` or by installing 
qubolite with `pip install qubolite[kendall_tau]`.

For exemplary QUBO embeddings (e.g. clustering or subset sum), the 
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) library is required. It can be installed by either using 
`pip install scikit-learn` or installing qubolite with `pip install qubolite[embeddings]`.

If you would like to install all optional dependencies you can use `pip install qubolite[all]` for
achieving this.

## Usage Examples

By design, `qubolite` is a shallow wrapper around `numpy` arrays, which represent QUBO parameters.
The core class is `qubo`, which receives a `numpy.ndarray` of size `(n, n)`.
Alternatively, a random instance can be created using `qubo.random()`.

```
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from qubolite import qubo
>>> arr = np.triu(np.random.random((8, 8)))
>>> Q = qubo(arr)
>>> Q2 = qubo.random(12, distr='uniform')
```

By default, `qubo()` takes an upper triangle matrix.
A non-triangular matrix is converted to an upper triangle matrix by adding the lower to the upper triangle.

To get the QUBO function value, instances can be called directly with a bit vector.
The bit vector must be a `numpy.ndarray` of size `(n,)` or `(m, n)`.

```
>>> x = np.random.random(8) < 0.5
>>> Q(x)
7.488225478498116
>>> xs = np.random.random((5,8)) < 0.5
>>> Q(xs)
array([5.81642745, 4.41380893, 11.3391062, 4.34253921, 6.07799747])
```

### Solving

The submodule `solving` contains several methods to obtain the minimizing bit vector or energy value of a given QUBO instance, both exact and approximative.

```
>>> from qubolite.solving import brute_force
>>> x_min, value = brute_force(Q, return_value=True)
>>> x_min
array([1., 1., 1., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0.])
>>> value
-3.394893116198653
```

The method `brute_force` is implemented efficiently in C and parallelized with OpenMP.
Still, for instances with more than 30 variables take a long time to solve this way.
